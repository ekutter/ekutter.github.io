  <div class="SectionHeader">Features</div>
  <ul>
    <li>Compatible with most Alpha and Astro devices</li>
    <li>Customize-able distance alerts - set the distance, enter tone, and exit tone</li>
    <li>Optional movement alert</li>
    <li>shows first 4 dogs on single display</li>
    <li>Indicates if dogs are moving or stationary</li>
    <li>Displays distance in yards or meters, depending on user settings</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="SectionHeader" id="ConfiguringSettings">Configuring Settings</div>
  <ul>
    <li>In Garmin Connect on your phone, select your "watch device / Connect IQ Apps / Applications / Dog Tracker App / settings"</li>
    <li>For the Alpha ID in settings, set it to "-1" to lock in the next Alpha found. Use "0" to have it always use the first Alpha it finds, but without locking it in for next time. Or enter the specific Alpha ID you want to always find. You can determine the Alpha ID by setting it to "-1" when no other Alpha's are around. It will then fill in this setting with the current Alpha ID.</li>
    <li>Alerts - Set the distance and tones. If you change one of the enter or exit tones (a number from 0 - 17) and and press save while your watch is connected to your phone, it will play the tone on update. This lets you try out various tones. A value of 0 means no tone.</li>
    <li>distance alert of zero turns off the distance alerts</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="SectionHeader" id="TroubleShooting">Trouble Shooting</div>
  <ul>
    <li>Please make sure you have the latest firmware for your Alpha/Astro 430 and "settings / Dogs / Broadcast Dog Data" set to On.</li>
    <li>The data being displayed is from a connection to the Alpha hand held. This does not work with just the dog collar.</li>
    <li>Troubles connecting to your Alpha: it may be due to conflicts with Garmin's Dog Tracker Widget. To fix it:
        <ul>
          <li>Run the Garmin Widget (down arrow from the watch face until you see it)</li>
          <li>Press the Start button to bring up the menu</li>
          <li>Select “forget this device”</li>
          <li>Exit out of the Widget with the Back button</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>"no dogs" : You have a connection to the Alpha/Astro but it doesn't see any dogs.  This is a connection
      issue between your Alpha/Astro and the dog collar, not with the Dog Tracker App. </li>
  </ul>
