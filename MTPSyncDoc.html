    <p>
        MTP Sync tool</p>
    <p>
        Aimed at garmin devices.&nbsp; The purpose is to aid in copying files to/from Media Transfer Protocol devices.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
        Use at your own risk: I&#39;m not going to guarantee you won&#39;t lose a file.&nbsp; Bugs happen.&nbsp; But I haven&#39;t run into any issues in several months.</p>
    <p>
        Any questions or issues please email me at <a href="mailto:eric@mtyquinn.com">eric@mtyquinn.com</a></p>
    <p>
        usage: download the following file: <a href="apps/MTPSync.zip">MTPSync.zip</a>. You can place MTPSync.exe anywhere on your computer and just create a convenient link to it.&nbsp; It will default to using <a href="file:///C:/MTPSync">C:\MTPSync</a> for the cache location.&nbsp; Through the menu&#39;s you can change that to anywhere. That is where the configuration file lives.&nbsp; If you change the folder, you&#39;ll lose all your current settings.</p>
    <p>
        My personal settings for each device are: auto-sync, assign cache drive letter, auto delete activities</p>
    <p>
        Features</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Keep Track of your devices</li>
        <li>Works with MTP and non MTP devices alike</li>
        <li>Auto detect - looks for MTP devices every 5 seconds.&nbsp; Performs sync on connected devices.&nbsp; enable/disable in File menu.</li>
        <li>Show connection status</li>
        <li>show last sync time</li>
        <li>Allow assigning drive letter for quick access to cache folder for a specific device.&nbsp; Really handy for the CIQ sdk - <a href="file:///m:/apps">m:\apps</a> for the target.  
             Note, it will create a network drive with the link.  You probably have to be an administrator. Force an update of the connections with "File\Update Network Drives"</li>
        <li>Automatically deletes files after sync (optional for activities and scorecards)</li>
        <li>Aliases names: different devices use different folder names for activities for example: Activity vs Activities.&nbsp; Always uses Activity on PC.</li>
        <li>trim old files in cache (you got to tell it with File\Trim) - it&#39;ll get really big otherwise</li>
        <li>rename files with date/device name on import when appropriate</li>
        <li>hide devices you don&#39;t often use</li>
        <li>Quick link to folders - double click on model name or drive letter to bring up folder in explorer.&nbsp; No way to automatically bring up device folder on MTP.</li>
        <li>File menu items generally are global</li>
        <li>Device menu items are generally device specific settings/operations</li>
        <li>Logging - all copy and delete operations are logged to MTPSyncLog.txt located in the same folder as MTPSync.exe. use &quot;File / View Log File&quot; to view in notepad.&nbsp; Feel free to delete it if it&#39;s getting too big.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        - MTP syncs the following folders from your device to a folder on you computer:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Activities</li>
        <li>Scorecards</li>
        <li>scrnshot</li>
        <li>Logs\Dbg, Logs\Bin</li>
        <li>Apps\Logs - and append .bak to .txt files in the process.&nbsp; Truncates .txt files after sync.</li>
        <li>Apps -&gt; Syncs PC to device. pre-build to convenient drive letter - auto copy to device when connected</li>
        <li>GarminDevices.xml - saves one per day / device</li>
    </ul>
