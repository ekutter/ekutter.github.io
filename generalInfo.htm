  There are 4 types of CIQ Apps which can definitely be confusing.  All 4 are generally referred to as Apps, 
    although Applications are also often refered to as just Apps.
    <ul class="Menus">
      <li>Watch Face - probably the most common CIQ app</li>
      <li>Data Field - These are place on data pages in regular activities like Running, Biking, etc.  
          You configure them just like any other data field like Time or Distance.  These don't get any direct
          user input and are very limited in the memory they can use.  Often they are designed to take up the entire 
          screen when a data page is configured as a single field for the full page.  Dog Tracker Field will only 
          display 4 dogs if configured to take up the entire display
      </li>
      <li>Application - These are the most flexible apps and replace the entire UI of the device.  Dog Tracker Plus
          and Dog Tracker App are full applications.  These don't run in a regular activity like the fields do so
          it is up to the application to handle all button presses, activity recording, and page managment.  On most
          devices, you start an Application just like any built in activity like running or biking.  It will be 
          displayed in the activity list or under a special activity called Connect IQ.
      </li>
      <li>Widget - These are lighter weight apps intended for quickly viewing something and then going right back 
        to the watch face.  Garmin's dog tracking app for several of it's devices is a widget.
      </li>
    </ul>
