    This is an early version for you to try out. Constructive feed back is appreciated.  Due to memory limitations on some devices
    there are currently no customizable settings and the number of dogs is limited.  With enough interest, I will add advanced
    features for devices with more memory (F6 Pro, FR945, FR245music, etc).

  <ul>
    <li>Please make sure you have the latest firmware for your Alpha/Astro 430 and "settings / Dogs / Broadcast Dog Data" set to On.</li>
    <li>The data being displayed is from a connection to the Alpha hand held. This does not work with just the dog collar.</li>
    <li>Troubles connecting to your Alpha: it may be due to conflicts with Garmin's Dog Tracker Widget. To fix it:
        <ul>
          <li>Run the Garmin Widget (down arrow from the watch face until you see it)</li>
          <li>Press the Start button to bring up the menu</li>
          <li>Select “forget this device”</li>
          <li>Exit out of the Widget with the Back button</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>"no dogs" : You have a connection to the Alpha/Astro but it doesn't see any dogs.  This is a connection
      issue between your Alpha/Astro and the dog collar, not with the Dog Tracker App. </li>
      <li>This data field does not work in conjunction with my other dog tracker field.  You can only be using one at a
          time in any one activity or they will compete for connection to the Alpha.  However, you can place this data field
          on multiple pages (most devices limit to 2) to insert the dog arrow in a multi field page.
      </li>
  </ul>
