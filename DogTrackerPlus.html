  <ul>
    <li>Please make sure you have the latest firmware for your Alpha/Astro 430 and "settings / Dogs / Broadcast Dog Data" set to On.</li>
    <li>Troubles connecting to your Alpha: it may be due to conflicts with Garmin's Dog Tracker Widget. To fix it:
        <ul>
          <li>Run the Garmin Widget (down arrow from the watch face until you see it)</li>
          <li>Press the Start button to bring up the menu</li>
          <li>Select “forget this device”</li>
          <li>Exit out of the Widget with the Back button</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li> "no dogs" : You have a connection to the Alpha/Astro but it doesn't see any dogs.  This is a connection
      issue between your Alpha/Astro and the dog collar, not with the Dog Tracker App. </li>
