    Dog Tracker Plus can track annonymous diagnostics information about its usage.  
    You can disable this through the menus by turning off Automatic Diagnostics.  
    If enabled, it will send basic configuration and usage information including watch model and id (not the serial number), 
    watch fw version, tracking device, max dog count, configuration settings (like which features are enabled), 
    and general region being used (rounded to about 100km).

    no user identifying information and will only be used for Dog Tracker Plus improvement.  It will not be shared
    with any third parties, including Garmin, and will not be used for profit in any way.
